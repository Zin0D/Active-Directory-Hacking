# Active Directory: 
- This repository focuses on hacking and compromising the `Active-Directory` security within an internal network.

## What Is Active Directory?
Active Directory is a directory service developed by Microsoft that provides:
- **Centralized management** of users, computers, and resources.
- **Authentication and authorization** through Kerberos and LDAP.
- **Organized structure** of domains, forests, and trusts to manage access across networks.

##  How to Hack Active Directory
Hacking AD involves several key stages:
1. **Enumeration**  
   Discover and map the AD environment, looking for misconfigurations, weak credentials, and vulnerable services.

2. **Exploitation**  
   Use techniques like:
   - LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning
   - SMB Relay attacks
   - Kerberoasting 
   - Golden-Ticket attacks
   - GPP / cPassword
   - Pass-the-Hash 
   - Pass-the-Password
   - Access Control List attack
   - Dsync attacks
   - Dangerous priviliges
   - Abusing Vulnerable legacy systems (Eternal Blue...)
   - Abusing misconfigured printers using LDAP
   - And much more.

3. **Privilege Escalation**  
   Gain domain administrator privileges by leveraging AD-specific attack paths.

4. **Post-Exploitation**  
   Maintain access, pivot to other machines, and exfiltrate valuable data.
